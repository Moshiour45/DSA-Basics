Prefix - Postfix - Prefix Notation

Infix : 
The way human eye sees mathematical equations is most likely to be known as Infix Notation. 
For example : 
1. (a + b) 
2. ((a*x) + (b*y) + c)

Postfix:
The core idea behind postfix notation is to make calcutaions easier for CPU! For example:

Expression : (a + b) 
if hypothetically, CPU is trying to calculate the expression the way we write it infix, then it will firs look for 
operators (+,-,*,/). In our case it will look for '+' once it gets '+' then it will look for operands, in our case a and b! The process is complicated! Why we are saying so?

Let's say that the CPU is trying to look for operands using a pointer and we name that pointer to be - pointer

                                                (a + b) 
                                                   ^
                                                   |
                                                   |
                                                  ptr
now to actually perform the "+" operation we need two operands a and b! We can easily access b by performing ptr + 1 because ptr + 1 is loacted just after ptr! To get "a" we need to have another pointer! Let's assume we do have another pointer that is ptrBack;
                                               ( a  + b ) 
                                                 ^  ^ 
                                                 |  |
                                                 |  |
                                           ptrBack  ptr
As it appears the equation can be evaluated by using infix notation! Not really! let's take the second example -
Expression : a*x + b*y + c

In this case ptr, ptr + 1 and ptrBack will give wrong result! You can try it yourself!


To avoid such complications, we are introduced with postfix notation! In case of postfix notation we put the operands first and the put operators:

Postfix of (a + b) : ab+
Postfix of (a*x + b*y + c) : ax*by*+c+

Steps to connvert into postfix:
1. According to the precedence apply braces into the expression. Keep the expression as it has braces already!
2. According to the associativity of operators perform operation on an operator.
3. Wrtie operands first and then put operator.
4. Repeat same for all.

Example Expression : a + b * c - d

Step-1: Apply braces according to precedence
((a + (b * c)) - d)

Step-2: Apply associativity: So evaluate from left to right
For (b * c) :
bc*

Therefore, the expression -
((a + (bc*)) - d)
((abc*+) - d)
abc*+d-

Postfix Notation: abc*+d-


Prefix :
It is same as postfix notation but first put operators and then put operands!

Prefix notation of ((a + (b * c)) - d) : -+a*bcd
